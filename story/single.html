						<h1>1. The Placement Process</h1>
						<p>With around 300 companies visiting our campus every year for various profiles,
						there is no doubt that NITK is itself is a brand and a very important tag with our
						name. To make this magic happens, the placement team works very hard behind
						the curtain and for the smooth process. The process for the placement is:-
						</p>
						<span class="blog-img"><img src="images/civil101bpic1.png"></span>
						<p>One thing that is common for all profiles irrespective of the profile is good
							communication skills which you can’t learn in one night. Having good
							communication is key to the placement. Refer to the resource section for
							improving your soft skills.
							</p>
						<h1>2. Various Profiles Companies Offer</h1>
						<p>The different profiles that any company offers at NITK for civil can be classified as :
							<ul>
							<li>2.1 Coding Profile</li>
							<li>2.2 Analytics Profile</li>
							<li>2.3 Teaching Profile</li>
							<li>2.4 Management Profile</li>
							<li>2.5 Content and Media profile</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>2.1 Coding Profile</h2>
						<p>Most of the companies that are open
						to civil engineering students and of
						coding profile offer the role of
						software developer and the question
						paper pattern is nearly the same for all
						companies, check out the resource
						section for important languages.

						</p>
						<p><b>Online Test</b> : Questions are asked on
							Data structures and Algorithm which
							you can practise on different platforms
							like HackerEarth, HackerRank,
							CodeForces, Codechef, Geeks For
							Geeks (Best). You can learn any major
							programming language you want, but
							it is advisable to learn C++/Java from
							the placement perspective. They will
							also ask Aptitude questions and
							sometimes verbal ability also.
</p>
						</p>
						<p><b>Technical Interview</b> : The technical
							interview is generally based on Data
							Base Management Systems (DBMS), Data
							Structure & Algorithm (DSA). Object-
							Oriented Programming ( OOPS) and
							Operating System (OS). Again it can vary
							from profile to profile, some times
							company expect students that they also
							know about Machine learning or UI/UX.
							So, it depends, but questions from OOPS,
							DSA, DBMS and from OS are from sure.
							They will also ask some Logical and
							Reasoning questions. And last but not
							least, they will ask question-based on
							your resume (Projects and internships
							mainly).
							</p>
						<p><b>HR Interview</b>: Don’t take this interview
						lightly, many people got rejected after
						HR and the questions can be prepared
						earlier so prepare for this round also. “
						Why do you want to apply for the
						software profile instead of a Core
						profile?” This questions will be asked
						from you in every interview, prepare well
						for this and <b>don’t answer like “I don’t
						like civil”</b>, don’t curse your own branch,
						it will leave a bad impression, reply with
						a positive answer. Your answer should be
						convincing and reasonable. They will also
						ask questions on “Why Should We Hire
						You?” “What are the values of this
						company”. Refer to resources for more
						details.
						 </p>
						 <h2>2.2 Analytics Profile</h2>
						 <p>We have reached an era where we are
							generating 2.5 Billion GB data every day. So,
							it is clear that the companies need
							someone who can collect, segregate,
							analyse the data, pinpoint trends and
							pattern and make reports from it. So, here
							analyst comes into the picture. The analyst
							uses different tools and programming
							languages which some companies expect
							from the student should know. There are ‘n’
							no. of tools and programming languages
							present on the internet one can use, but
							most common ones are SQL (Language)
							and Excel. SQL is Structured Query
							Language, which is a programming
							language for storing, manipulating and
							retrieving data stored in a relational
							database.SQL is the standard language for
							Relational Database System. All the
							Relational Database Management Systems
							(RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle,
							Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server
							use SQL as their standard database
							language. Knowing the basic of Python OR
							Data Visualisation using Python will surely
							give you some edge.
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Technical Test</b> : The test for Data Analytics
							will vary from company to company. But, if
							you’re an individual who neither likes core
							nor coding, then prepare well for the
							following topics, some companies ask
							questions from all the below topics, some
							companies will ask from few.
							1. Aptitude (Common for all)
							2. Logical Reasoning (Common for all)
							3. Verbal ability (Common for all)
							4. Data Interpretation
							5. Statistics

							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Technical Interview</b>: Technical Interview:
							The interview is generally based on
							guesstimates, puzzles questions, case
							studies and on your resume. Questions
							based on SQL (Queries on Joins; creating,
							altering database etc) and on Excel (Pivot
							tables, Macros, VBA) also being asked by the
							panel sometimes. Go through your resume,
							and prepare well on the above topics

							</p>
							<p>
							<b>HR Interview</b> : Again, Questions like “Why
							Analytics and not core civil?” “What are the
							responsibilities of Analytics?”,”Why should
							we hire you?” are being asked by HR. Be
							sure you give positive, convincing and
							reasonable answers with a smile. Also, refer
							to the resource section for more details.
								
							</p>
							<h2>2.3 Core Profile</h2>
						 <p><b>“The package for the civil profile is very
							low”, we all know this and this is a fact,
							but, no one understands why</b>. The
							difference between the circuit branch
							and core branch is that the people of
							the circuit branch are studying and
							applying engineering during the
							college, while, core branch (especially
							civil) is just studying engineering . It’s
							a natural constraint. Just imagine you
							want to design a home for yourself,
							Would you prefer a design from a just-
							graduated student or from an
							experienced engineer/professor. The
							package in civil branch increases after
							2-3 years after you gain some
							experience, and, there are many
							vacancies in state/central government
							for civil graduates.

							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Online Test</b> :  This test includes
							aptitude and questions from core
							subjects.Mechanics of material, Civil
							engineering materials and
							construction, Soil mechanics, Design
							of RCC, Structural analysis-1, Structural
							analysis-2, Highway and traffic
							engineering, Environmental
							engineering and Design of steel
							structure. Make sure that prepare for
							well for Civil engineering materials and
							construction, RCC, SA-1, Steel and soil
							mechanics very well, because 90%
							questions of the question paper come
							from these topics

							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Technical Interview</b>: In this interview,
							they will ask you what are your 2
							favorite subjects and they will ask
							questions from those subjects. If
							possible, choose steel and structure.


							</p>
							<p>
							<b>HR Interview</b> : The HR Interview will be
							like any other simple HR Interview, like,
							" What are the role and values of civil
							engineering?", "Why should we hire
							you?" and <b>basic HR questions. Refer to
							resources to more information.</b>
