							<h2>The Team</h2>
							<dl class="alt">
								<p>We are highly motivated students from NITK Surathkal. We ourselves, at many points in our life, thought we lacked guidance regarding our career and thought it would have been if we had a mentor. Many students are not able to find a mentor which can give them career guidance. So, we thought of developing a platform for connecting students to the professionals and we named it MentorMony</p>
